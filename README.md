## *Description*
For this assignment, we were required to create a employee directory with React. It required a break up of the application's UI into components, manage component state, and response to user events.

## *User Story*

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

* An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

* Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

* The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
## *Usage*
  The deployed application is available at this [GitHub Pages link](https://bwaycarl.github.io/React-Employee-Directory/).
